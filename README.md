# cnp-monitoring-demo
In this demo I create the Postgres cluster in a Kubernetes environment using the EDB Kubernetes operator and configure the monitoring of the cluster using Grafana dashboards.  The demo is based on the SNP Sandbox project, which can be found here: https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/cnp-sandbox/tree/main/charts/cnp-sandbox
